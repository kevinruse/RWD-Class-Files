    <p><dfn>MyPlate</dfn> is a reminder to find your healthy eating style and build it throughout your lifetime. Everything you eat and drink matters. The right mix can help you be healthier now and in the future. This means:
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on variety, amount, and nutrition.</li>
        <li>Choose foods and beverages with less saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars.</li>
        <li>Start with small changes to build healthier eating styles.</li>
        <li>Support healthy eating for everyone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Eating healthy is a journey shaped by many factors, including our stage of life, situations, preferences, access to food, culture, traditions, and the personal decisions we make over time. All your food and beverage choices count. MyPlate offers ideas and tips to help you create a healthier eating style that meets your individual needs and improves your health. <sup>1</sup> The content above is from the United States Department of Agriculture's website called ChooseMyPlate.gov</p>
