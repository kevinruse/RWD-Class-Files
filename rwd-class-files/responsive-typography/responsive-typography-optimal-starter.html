		<p>ChooseMyPlate.gov provides practical information to individuals, health professionals, nutrition educators, and the food industry to help consumers build healthier diets with resources and tools for dietary assessment, nutrition education, and other user-friendly nutrition information. As Americans are experiencing epidemic rates of overweight and obesity, the online resources and tools can empower people to make healthier food choices for themselves, their families, and their children.

		<p>MyPlate illustrates the five food groups that are the building blocks for a healthy diet using a familiar image -- a place setting for a meal. Before you eat, think about what goes on your plate or in your cup or bowl.</p>
