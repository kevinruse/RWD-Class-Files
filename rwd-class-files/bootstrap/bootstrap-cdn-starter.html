<h1>Acquiring Bootstrap from a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h1>
<p>Acquiring Bootstrap from a CDN provides some benefits as well as some limitations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The CDN delivers a pure CSS file, therefore, there is no opportunity for preprocessing CSS.</li>
	<li>There may (or may not: you have to test!) be longer load times.</li>
	<li>There will be no Bootstrap customization opportunities.</li>
	<li>The Bootstrap library located at the CDN may have been cached by your user, resulting in a faster startup
		time.
	</li>
</ul>
