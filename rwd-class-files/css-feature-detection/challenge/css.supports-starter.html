    <h1>Feature Detection with @supports</h1>
    <h2>From the W3C website</h2>
    <p>at: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/">https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/</a></p>
    <p>The ‘@supports’ rule allows CSS to be conditioned on implementation support for CSS properties and values. This rule makes it much easier for authors to use new CSS features and provide good fallback for implementations that do not support those features. This is particularly important for CSS features that provide new layout mechanisms, and for other cases where a set of related styles needs to be conditioned on property support.</p>
    <p>Each conditional group rule has a condition, which at any time evaluates to true or false. When the condition is true, CSS processors must apply the rules inside the group rule as though they were at the group rule's location; when the condition is false, CSS processors must not apply any of rules inside the group rule. The current state of the condition does not affect the CSS object model, in which the contents of the group rule always remain within the group rule.</p>

    <p> This means that when multiple conditional group rules are nested, a rule inside of both of them applies only when all of the rules' conditions are true.</p>
